In modern compilers, single static assignment (SSA) has become a standard theory
for internal representations. A fundamental part of SSA is calculating and using
domination relations that determines where variables can be referenced.  A data
structure called the dominator tree has historically been a very good
approximation of the dominator relation. Unfortunately, there are programs in
which the dominator tree fails to capture precise dominator relations,
preventing optimizations. In this paper, we give examples of these kinds of
programs, and show how generalizing the dominator tree to a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) computes more precise domination relations, enabling more
optimizations for sequential programs. We implement the approach in LLVM, a
popular optimizing SSA compiler.  

In addition to improving optimizations for sequential programs, we discuss
applications to concurrent SSA theory. We discuss how SSA can be extended with
concurrent semantics, and why the dominator DAG is necessary to capture precise
domination relation for any concurrent semantics.
